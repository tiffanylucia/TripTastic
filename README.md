# TripTastic
I have designed a website called TripTastic. It is a simple website that allows users to plan their trips. 
The colour system is a combination of blue and white, which gives a sense of calmness and serenity.
The pallete includes:
Primary colours- #87CEEB (a light blue colour) and #FFFFFF (white)
Secondary colours- #F7F7F7 (a light grey colour) and #3498
Neutrals - #F2F2F2 (a light grey colour) and #E5E5
Accent colours- #3498 (a dark blue colour) and #F7F7F7 
The rationale behind the colour scheme is to create a sense of calmness and serenity, which is perfect for
a travel-planning website. The blue colour represents the sky and the sea, which are often associated
with travel and relaxation. The white colour represents clarity and simplicity, which is perfect for a website that needs to be easy to navigate.
The breakpoint logic is as follows:
- For large screens with a width of 1200px and above, the layout will be a standard
layout with a header, a hero section, a main content section, and a footer. And when the website is opened it will appear as one column.
- For medium screens with a width of 768px to 991px, the layout will be a
standard layout with a header, a hero section, a main content section, and a footer.And when the website is opened it will appear in two columns.
- For small screens with a width of 576px to 767px, the layout will be a
standard layout with a header, a hero section, a main content section, and a footer.And when the website is opened it will appear as two columns as well.
I have diverged a little differently from the mockup by:
- Using different fonts and text styles.
- Adding a few animations and hover effects.
- Making the images more expressive.
- Adjusting the padding, spacing and alignment.
- Using some few new components that were not in the original mockup.
